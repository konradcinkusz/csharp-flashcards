# CSharp FlashCards 2025

A set of Beamer-based flash-card slides for C\#/.NET topics, designed for live classroom or self-study presentations.  
Each “area” (beginner, intermediate, threading, design, LINQ, etc.) is a Beamer **section** whose first slide shows a mini-table-of-contents of that area, followed by question/answer slides as **subsections**.

---

## Purpose

- **Learn & teach C\#**: turn core concepts into bite-sized Q&A slides.
- **Reusable slide deck**: easily add/remove topics by dropping in `areas/*.tex`.
- **Auto-generated TOCs**:
  - **Global TOC** at the start, chunked into multiple pages.
  - **Per-section TOC** slide(s) showing only that area’s questions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/CSharp-FlashCards-2025.git

     \input{areas/your-topic}
     ```
2. **Add Q\&A**

   * In your `.tex` file, use:
